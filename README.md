# TMDb-Kotlin-Android

Hi this is my Interview Question result , i do learn really much from it , but i hardly finish it , as i develop it in the time of working and learning, Hope you like the code.

1. the RxJava and Retrofit2 i learnt on the spots, its pretty fun and useful.
2. the MVVM i didnt applied as i learnt the MVP version when i learning this as well as i using MVC on my current work.
3. Dangger and Data Binding I am really fresh on these.

Thanks for giving chance to learn this Libraries.
Best Regards
Stefan
